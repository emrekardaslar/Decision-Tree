# Decision-Tree
The algorithm uses entropy and gain calculations to draw a decision tree. By changing the dataset and "columns" array in class "Table", 
the algorithm can be used to draw different decision trees.

The dataset used in this example can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer).
